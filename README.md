Twitter Heroes is a project that detects profanity (insults) and hate speech (racism, sexism) in tweets written in English. Notable features include:

1. Detection of insults and hate speech.
2. Analysis of influence (on replies and retweets).
3. Generating plots and figures based on relevant statistics (likes, retweets).
4. Censorship of insults using asterisks (*).
5. Text alteration through circular translation (Google Translate through multiple languages until back to English).
6. Visualization of retweets and replies on a world map based on their locations.
